### WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We only process your information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.

_If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you._

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your information:

* Consent: We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
* Performance of a Contract: We may process your information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
Legitimate Interests: We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your information for some of the purposes described in order to:
Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services;
Analyze how our services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users;
Support our marketing activities;
Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities;
Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience.

Legal Obligations: We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
Vital Interests: We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

In legal terms, we are generally the “data controller” under European data protection laws of the information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the information we process as a “data processor” on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the “data controller” responsible for your information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.

No data stored within the Service is ever transfered or transmitted off of the user's device at any time or for any reason.

### Security Of Data
All data input into the Service is stored locally and securely encrypted using the password specified by the user and its biometrics whenever available.

We will let you know via a prominent notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "effective date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.
